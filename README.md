### Hello Cube (https://teresewang.itch.io/mca1)
A simple animation to practice on using unity. 
When the game begins, the Cube should learn about the capsules in the scene and move towards each of them at once. When the cube is close enough to the capsule, the capsule will be destroyed. The process continues until no capsule remained. The capsule will print the message about where the cube is moving toward to them. 

### Cat-Dog-Fight (https://teresewang.itch.io/mac2)
Player needs to eat the required number of mice available on the level before times up and also avoid being caught by the dog. In addition, garbage will also be available on the ground, if collected, player will get sick and one of the mice they collected will be reduced.
